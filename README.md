# Playlist Manager (v0.1 alpha)

Playlist Manager is a program designed to organize all the songs on your playlist. This is the minimally functional alpha version. It has enough features that it is somewhat useful, but not nearly all the features have been implemented yet. In future versions, Playlist Manager will make creating a playlist easier and quicker than can be done through a streaming site's interface. It will eventually allow exporting a ```.txt``` file. There are a handful of sites out there that can import playlists into Spotify, Pandora, etc. from a ```.txt```. Thus Playlist Manager will eventually allow you to create playlists on those sites without having to deal with their slow, clunky interfaces. However, many major features have not yet been completed as of this initial alpha build.

## Current Features

In v0.1a, the following features are present:

- Can add bands, albums and songs
- Can view all data in a table
- Can save files in ```.JSON``` format

## Missing Features

As mentioned, numerous major and minor features have not yet been implemented, including (but not limited to):

- Querying data by band, album, song, year, etc.
- Marking bands, albums, and songs as favorites
- Adding tags for bands, albums, songs
- An improved data structure system that can handle duplicate names
- Exporting to a ```.txt``` that can be imported into sites such as Spotify or Pandora
- Exporting to a ```.csv``` or ```.xlsx```, allowing data to be viewed in other programs, such as Excel
- Deleting data
- Modifying data
