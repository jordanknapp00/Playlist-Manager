# Playlist Manager (v0.3 alpha)

Playlist Manager is a program designed to organize all the songs on your playlist. Playlist Manager makes creating a playlist easier and quicker than doing it through a streaming site's interface. It will eventually allow exporting a ```.txt``` file. There are a handful of sites out there that can import playlists into Spotify, Pandora, etc. from a ```.txt```. Thus Playlist Manager will eventually allow you to create playlists on those sites without having to deal with their slow, clunky interfaces.

## Current Features

In v0.3a, the following features are present:

- Can add bands, albums and songs
- Can view all data in a table
- Can save files in ```.JSON``` format
- Can modify data, including applying tags and marking entries as favorites
- Can query specific band/album/song names, tags, favorite status, etc.

## Missing Features

Some features have not yet been implemented, including (but not limited to):

- Exporting to a ```.txt``` that can be imported into sites such as Spotify or Pandora
- Exporting to a ```.csv``` or ```.xlsx```, allowing data to be viewed in other programs, such as Excel
