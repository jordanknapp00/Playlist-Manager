# Playlist Manager (v0.3 alpha)

Playlist Manager is a program designed to organize all the songs on your playlist. This is alpha version 3. It has enough features that it is somewhat useful, but not nearly all the features have been implemented yet. In future versions, Playlist Manager will make creating a playlist easier and quicker than can be done through a streaming site's interface. It will eventually allow exporting a ```.txt``` file. There are a handful of sites out there that can import playlists into Spotify, Pandora, etc. from a ```.txt```. Thus Playlist Manager will eventually allow you to create playlists on those sites without having to deal with their slow, clunky interfaces. However, many major features have not yet been completed as of this initial alpha build.

## Current Features

In v0.3a, the following features are present:

- Can add bands, albums and songs
- Can view all data in a table
- Can save files in ```.JSON``` format
- Can modify data, including adding tags and marking entries as favorites
- Improved data structures that can handle duplicate names
- Querying data by entry name, album year, track number, favorite status, etc.

## Missing Features

As mentioned, numerous major and minor features have not yet been implemented, including (but not limited to):

- Exporting to a ```.txt``` that can be used to import into streaming services
- Exporting to a ```.csv``` or ```.xlsx```, allowing data to be viewed in other programs, such as Excel
- Additional QOL improvements
